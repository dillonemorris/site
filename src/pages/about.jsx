                I've always had diverse interests. I love sports. As a kid I was
                obsessed with basketball and recently got back into it, playing
                pick-up games at my gym. I’m also a huge golf nerd and try to
                get out and play as much as I can. I’ve always had a passion for
                music and have played the guitar since the 6th grade (it doesn’t
                show). With these and other diverse interests I'm able to find
                common ground with anyone and see things from different
                perspectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m a former customer service professional and have ingrained
                empathy for end users. I started in tech because that’s where I
                felt I could have the biggest impact helping people. I love this
                field because there is something new to learn every single day.
                I try not to make too many assumptions based on previous
                knowledge. You are never too good to go back to the drawing
                board, to see things in a new light.

                I am a developer specializing in React, Next and Typescript. I
                also have experience in React Native, having worked extensively
                on a fitness app at my previous company, Synapse Studios.
                Currently, I get to wield and grow these skills at a company
                called Formidable. Right now I’m part of a team helping a big
                name clothing brand migrate to React. I love being part of a
                team and take pride in helping others level up while learning
                from those who can help me fill my own knowledge gaps.
